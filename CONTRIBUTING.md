## Running locally

The project shouldn't require anything more than the `rust-toolchain.toml` version of Rust specified which you can set up with `rustup`. 

### Setting Up Python

You'll also need to set up a python virtualenv and install dependencies as follows:

```bash
virtualenv .venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
make python_install
```

### Running Tests

Once you have that the following runs the test suite. 

#### Rust Tests

```bash
make rust_test
```

#### Python Tests

```bash
make python_test
```

## VS Code Setup

Run the following command to set up your VS Code environment using the recommended settings:

```bash
make load_vscode_settings
```

## Releasing

1. Bump the versions in `sqruff-lib/Cargo.toml` and `sqruff/Cargo.toml`.
2. Commit the changes.
3. Push the changes.
4. Tag the commit with the new version
5. Release `sqruff-lib` crate

```bash
cargo publish -p sqruff-lib
```

6. Release `sqruff` crate

```bash
cargo publish -p sqruff
```

## Running extension locally in browser

To run the extension locally, install npm in the `editors/code` directory and run the following commands:

```bash
npm run build:wasm_lsp && npm run compile && npm run run-in-browser
```

## Updating the fixtures for the dialect tests (the yaml files)

One of the big set of tests that exist in the codebase are those to ensure the parsing of the SQL dialects is correct. These tests are stored in `crates/lib/test/fixtures/dialects` and there is a folder for each dialect. In each folder there is an a set of sql files and an accompanying yaml file that contains the expected output of parsing the sql file. To update the yaml files, run the tests with the `UPDATE_EXPECT` environment variable set to `1`.

```bash
env UPDATE_EXPECT=1 cargo test
```
